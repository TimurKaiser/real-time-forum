# REAL-TIME FORUM

The purpose of this project is to add a real time chat to the previous forum.

It is supposed to work like any forum but in this one, you will have to register yourself to access to it. This one is a **SPA (Single Page Application)**, that means there is only one **html** file : everything is handled is javascript !

## STEPS

The steps :

    - 1rst: Git clone the repository
    - 2nd: Launch the programm with this command :
        $ go run .

    - 3rd: Click on the link in the terminal, it will redirects you on your localhost
    - 4rth: Log in if you are already registered or create an account
    - 5th: Enter the forum

**Feel free to go through the forum**

## CHAT

Once connected and in the forum, you have **access** to the **chat** by **clicking** on the **icon** in the navbar.
Here is how it works :

- You will see if a user is connected and if he is in the chat page.
- To chat with another user, click on his username and start the conversation !
- Notifications appear on the bottom of the page
